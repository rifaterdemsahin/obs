This is VS Code running a **"File Rename" participant** — this happens when you rename a file and VS Code (or an extension) is processing all the related references/imports to update them across your project.

It can get "stuck" or take a long time because:

- A large codebase with many files to scan
- A slow extension handling the rename (TypeScript language server, Pylance, etc.)
- The extension is indexing or re-resolving all import paths

**To see what's happening:**

1. **Output panel** → `View > Output` → select the relevant language server (e.g. "TypeScript", "Pylance") from the dropdown
2. **Extension Host logs** → `Help > Toggle Developer Tools` → Console tab — look for errors or hanging promises
3. **Process Explorer** → `Help > Open Process Explorer` — see which process is eating CPU
4. **Cancel and retry** — hit Cancel, then try the rename again; sometimes it's a one-off hang

If it keeps locking up, the usual culprit is the **TypeScript/JS language server** struggling with a large project. You can try adding a `tsconfig.json` with `exclude` patterns to limit what it scans, or disable "Update imports on file move" in settings temporarily.
