## Locked Files During OBS Backup

When OBS Studio is running, the browser plugin keeps several files locked:

- `plugin_config/obs-browser/Network/Cookies`
- `plugin_config/obs-browser/Network/Cookies-journal`
- `plugin_config/obs-browser/first_party_sets.db`
- `plugin_config/obs-browser/SharedStorage-wal`
- `plugin_config/obs-browser/obs_profile_cookies_youtube/.../LOCK`

### Symptom

`backup-obs-config.ps1` prints warnings like:

```
Skipped (locked): plugin_config\obs-browser\Network\Cookies
```

### Cause

OBS holds an exclusive file lock on browser cookie databases and LevelDB storage
while it is running (via the Chromium Embedded Framework / CEF process).

### Fix

**Close OBS Studio before running the backup script** to allow a complete copy
of all browser source state.

If a partial backup (with locked files skipped) is acceptable, the script handles
this gracefully with try/catch and reports the count of skipped files.

### Impact

Skipping these files means browser source cookies (e.g. YouTube login state) are
not included in the backup. After a restore, you may need to re-authenticate in
browser sources. All scene JSON files and profiles are unaffected.
